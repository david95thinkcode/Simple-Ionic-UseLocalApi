## PART 2 : Retrieve datas from Ionic App using HttpClient
Here, we will fetch datas from the local API we've created at the [PART 1](https://github.com/david95thinkcode/Simple-LocalApi). So make sure, you've successfully implemented the API like part 1 shows.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you've installed :
- Node.js
- Cordova and Ionic command-line tools

## How to run it ?
- Download this repository or just clone it
- Extract files
- Inside the repo folder, open your terminal and run **`npm install`** to install dependancies.
- At the end of dependancies installation, run **`ionic serve`** to run your the app on the browser.

## How to be sure everything is working well ?
When everything is ok, your default web browser should automaticly open and show you the app.
If you see the following image, so it's fine !
